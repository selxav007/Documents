A private member is only accessible within the same class as it is declared. 
A member with no access modifier is only accessible within classes in the same package. 
A protected member is accessible within all classes in the same package and within subclasses in other packages


Abstract classes are classes that contain one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method that 
is declared, but contains no implementation. Abstract classes may not be instantiated, 
and require subclasses to provide implementations for the abstract methods.
